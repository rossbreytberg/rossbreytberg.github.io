    Roommate asleep when you want to voice chat? No problem! This app turns what
    you type into audio that can be send to any output device you choose.
    Combine with a virtual microphone such as VB-Cable and you'll be able to
    talk to your friends on Skype, Discord, and more simply by typing.

    Like the name implies, <a href="https://github.com/rossbreytberg/polls">Polls</a> allows people to ask each other questions and both vote and comment on them. The question asker can set a color for each option in the poll and the comments are then color-coded based on the commenter's vote. It is also possible to filter out comments by poll option.
